## 👋 Hi, I’m Harmony

Cybersecurity student. Curious about how things work. Even more curious about how they break.

### 🧠 What I’m learning
- **Bash / Command Line** – exploring Linux, scripting, and automation  
- **C** – understanding programs from the inside out  
- **Python** – turning problems into scripts  

### 🔍 Interests
- Skip tracing and OSINT  
- How systems are built and manipulated  
- Psychology and human behavior

### 🌱 How I learn
- Push buttons and see what happens  
- Figure out why the buttons did what they did  
- Apply what I learned immediately  

### 📌 Goals
- Get comfortable working in Linux environments  
- Strengthen fundamentals in C and Python  
- Build practical cybersecurity skills through small projects
